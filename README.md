# spellCheck

This repository is a project that simulates a spell checker on a cell phone, for example, using the levenshtein distance ready algorithm to provide the user with the three closest words that the user inserts into the textarea. As there is no database of words for the project, I chose to use a .txt file referring to the correct words for possible comparisons, so to be able to use the project, you must insert the .txt file in the file part of the page, only then everything will be in compliance to work.
